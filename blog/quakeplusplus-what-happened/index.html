<h1>Quake++ - What Happened?</h1>
<h3>The Past, Present, and Potential Future of My Ambitious Quake Remaster</h3>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A while ago, I announced to the Quake community at large that I was working on a visual remaster and gameplay tweak of the 1996 classic Quake. My goals were immensely ambitious, and ultimately unfulfilled. I was working from an Android phone at the time and was unable to do much direct level editing, so instead I replaced and remastered textures, added realtime lighting, and modified the entities in the levels to add decorative gore like how DOOM had. Ultimately, while I accomplished a lot of impressive effects, there was even more I wanted to do that I just couldn't, and I got burned out. I did make a promise a while back that any canceled projects of mine will be released exactly as I have them, and so I have released the entire mod as it currently is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12NL7Sb42xT8ktKN-MavOglYuWAwW0wTz?usp=sharing">here</a>. There's a lot I know is missing that I can't find, and a lot of hard work that seems to be gone, but it's what I'd have to use if I were to start working on it again. Speaking of which, I may someday pick this project back up. I sunk over a year of my time and effort into this project and I don't like having to abandon it like this, but my life is too hectic for me to look back at something like this. My hope is that someone else can use what I've done here to complete my vision, or perhaps create something even better than what I had envisioned, but for now that'll have to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I can however inform you all that I've been working on a proper game. I'm hesitant to fully announce it since development has already stagnated and I'm still working mostly solo, with only the occasional help from people like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://crxquake.com/credits">bucksh0t</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://microfox.dev/">Admer456</a>, but I really do hope to complete it. And if I do, I can promise you all that it'll be incredible.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I kinda have to keep this short, but I've shared all I really need to share anyway. Signing off for now, Laurarvix.</p>
